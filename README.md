## Overview

This script allows you to convert any text to speech using macOSâ€™s built-in Siri voices. You can save the spoken message as a WAV file, which can then be used in applications like Home Assistant for notifications or alerts.

The script works in two modes:
1. **Voice Selection Mode**: Allows you to choose a voice from the available Siri voices, and save that choice into a configuration file for future use.
2. **Text to Speech Mode**: Reads the voice from the config file and converts any entered text into speech. If no voice is selected, it will ask you to select one first.

### Features
- Uses macOS's `say` command for generating speech
- Converts AIFF files to WAV for cross-compatibility
- Automatically creates the output folder if it doesn't exist
- Plays the resulting audio file for quick feedback

## Requirements

- macOS (this script utilizes the `say` command, available on macOS)
- Python 3.x
- [Pixi](https://docs.pixi.sh/) for environment management

## Installation

To run this script, you need to have `pixi` set up. Follow these steps:

1. Install `pixi` by following their [installation guide](https://docs.pixi.sh/installation).

2. Once `pixi` is installed, navigate to the project folder and initialize the environment:

   ```bash
   pixi run speak
   ```

3. `pixi` will automatically install the necessary dependencies, like `pydub`, using the provided `pixi.toml` file.

## Usage

1. **Choosing a Voice**
   First, you need to choose a Siri voice that the script will use. To do this, run the script and select from the available voices:

   ```bash
   pixi run speak
   ```

   The script will display a list of available voices on your system. Choose one, and it will be saved for future use in a configuration file.

2. **Converting Text to Speech**
   Once you have a voice configured, you can enter the text you want spoken. The script will use the preselected voice and create a WAV file of the spoken message. This file will be saved in the `audio-files` folder.

   If the folder does not exist, it will be created automatically.

3. **Playing the Audio**
   After generating the WAV file, the script will automatically play the audio so you can verify that everything works as expected.

## Pixi

Pixi is a minimal environment manager, similar to Conda, that ensures your project dependencies and environment are consistent across platforms.

In this project, the `pixi.toml` file is used to define the project setup, including:

- The project name, version, and description.
- Dependencies (e.g., `pydub`) that the script requires.
- Task definitions, such as `speak`, which is the command that runs the Python script.

To get started with `pixi`, make sure you have it installed. Then, simply use the `pixi run` command to execute tasks:

```bash
pixi run speak
```

This command will install dependencies if necessary and run the `speak.py` script.
